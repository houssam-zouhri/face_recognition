# face_recognition
Facial recognition technology has gained more attention due to many applications such as video surveillance, criminal identification, building access control by security-conscious companies, and unmanned and
autonomous vehicles. This study is developing an intelligent facial recognition framework that detects faces
using the Oriented Gradient Histogram (HOG) and then facial recognition in images and video streams with
OpenCV. Our work presents a new approach, which involves identifying specific and distinctive details on
the face of a human working in any location. These details, like the distance between the eyes or the shape
of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces
collected in a facial recognition database. to finally build a facial recognition system that registers their
presence. our system showed a great capacity of facial recognition on all the faces on which it was trained,
or it was able to recognize people of a single image in the database and under a tolerance as low as 0.5. on
the other hand, the system has the ability to mark faces it has never seen as strangers, which is important
to avoid confusing strangersâ€™ faces with those in the database
